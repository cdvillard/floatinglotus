      <h2><center>Thanks for visiting The Floating Lotus!</center></h2>
      <p>
        Stress is everywhere! Large projects on tight deadlines, heavy traffic with obnoxious car horns, caught in the rain with no umbrella - all of things can easily make someone's day extremely unpleasant. Instead of letting all of that stress crash down on you like tidal waves, getting a massage can help you let it float away! The Floating Lotus, a mobile massage service serving South Florida, can help you relax and regain the energy you need to go about your day in a better mood! If this sounds like something you would like to try, please check this site often for updates as the website comes together.
